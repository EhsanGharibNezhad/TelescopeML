# Summary

We are on the verge of a revolutionary era in space exploration, thanks to advancements in ground- and space-based 
telescopes, such as the James Webb. These remarkable instruments collect an enormous amount of data from extrasolar 
atmospheres. Without an accurate interpretation of this data, the main objective of the space missions will not be 
fully accomplished. Different analytical and statistical methods, such as the chi-test and Bayesian statistics, 
are used in the context of forward- and retrieval-radiative transfer modeling to interpret these datasets and extract 
crucial information, such as atmospheric temperature, metallicity, Carbon-to-Oxygen ratio, and surface gravity. 
These atmospheric models rely on the synthetic training datasets generated by simulating the physics and chemistry 
of these atmospheres for a wide range of thermal structures and compositions. With the continuous observation of 
these objects and the increasing amount of data coming to Earth each day, there is a critical need for a systematic 
pipeline to explore the datasets and extract important information from them. This invaluable information will be 
utilized to provide insights about the diversity of exoplanets and brown dwarfs' atmospheric compositions and will 
help facilitate the long-term analysis of this data in research.

"TelescopeML" is a Python package consisting of a set of modules, each with specific machine learning or statistical 
functionality to perform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Machine Learning (ML) training on the telescope datasets 
captured from the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. The list of tasks that modules at  `TelescopeML`
performs are as follows:

    * _StatVisAnalyzer_: Explore and Process the synthetic datasets (or the training examples)
    * _DeepBuilder_: Specify traing and target features, Normalize/Scale datasets, Build CNN model
    * _DeepTrainer_: Create ML model, Train the model with the training examples, utilize hyperparameters
    * _Predictor_: Train the module using any given hyperparameters
