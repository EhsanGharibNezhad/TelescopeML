<p>In the following steps, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Load the brown dwarf dataset used to train the ML models.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare the X and y variables to deploy the trained ML models.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize them for a few cases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will need the following modules from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TelescopeML</span></code>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>DeepBuilder</strong>: to prepare the synthetic brown dwarf dataset and load the trained machine learning (ML) models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictor</strong>: to prepare the observational brown dwarf dataset and deploy the trained ML models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>StatVisAnalyzer</strong>: to provide statistical tests and plotting functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IO_utils</strong>: to provide functions to load the trained ML models.</p></li>

<p>Each spectrum has 104 wavelengths (i.e., 0.897, 0.906, â¦, 2.512 Î¼m) and 4 output atmospheric parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gravity (log <em>g</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>temperature (<em>T</em>eff)</p></li>
<li><p>carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O)</p></li>
<li><p>metallicity ([M/H])</p></li>
</ul>
