.. note::

    ``TelescopeML`` is written in `python3` and therefore requires an environment with python>=3.8.
    In order to utilize all modules in the library and their dependencies in full capacity (e.g., explore data,
    train ML/CNN models, predict results, and do more fun tasks), the following methods are recommended:


Method 1: Install via Pip
-----------------------------

The easiest way to install the most stable version is with *pip*, the Python package manager,
by the following steps:

1. Clone the repo and Create Anaconda environment named *TelescopeML*:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ehsangharibnezhad/TelescopeML.git
    cd TelescopeML
    conda TelescopeML create -f environment.yml


2. Activate the new environment and verify it:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate TelescopeML

3. Now install `TelescopeML` via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install TelescopeML

Method 2: Install with Git (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------
If you want to access the latest features or modify the code and contribute, we suggest that you clone the source code
from GitHub by following steps:

1. Clone the repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ehsangharibnezhad/TelescopeML.git


2. Create Conda environment named `TelescopeML`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd TelescopeML
    conda TelescopeML create -f environment.yml



3. Activate the new environment and verify it:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate TelescopeML


4. Install the library via the `setup.py` file:

4.1: If you want to only test the code without developing any of those modules, then:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/ehsangharibnezhad/TelescopeML.git
        cd TelescopeML
        python3 setup.py install

4.2: If you are thinking to develop the code, then you can install it using:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ehsangharibnezhad/TelescopeML.git
    cd TelescopeML
    python3 setup.py develop
