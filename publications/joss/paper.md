# Statement of Need

We are on in a new era of space exploration, thanks to advancements in ground- and space-based 
telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope [e.g., @JWST2023PASP] and CRIRES. These remarkable instruments collect high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra 
from extrasolar planets [e.g., @Alderson2023Nature], and brown dwarfs [e.g., @Miles2023ApJ] atmospheres. Without an accurate interpretation of this data, the main objectives 
of space missions will not be fully accomplished. Different analytical and statistical methods, such as the chi-squared-test, 
Bayesian statistics as well as radiative-transfer atmospheric modeling packages have been developed 
[e.g., @batalha2019picaso; @MacDonald2023POSEIDON] to interpret the spectra. They utilize either forward- and/or retrieval-radiative transfer modeling to analyze the spectra and 
extract physical information, such as atmospheric temperature, metallicity, carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and surface gravity 
[@line2014systematic; @Iyer2023Sphinx; @Marley2015]. These atmospheric models rely on generating the physics and chemistry of these atmospheres for a wide range of thermal structures 
and compositions. In addition to Bayesian-based techniques, machine learning and deep learning methods have been developed in recent years 
for various astronomical problems, including confirming the classification of light curves for 
exoplanet validation [e.g., @Valizadegan2021], recognizing molecular features  [@Zingales2018ExoGAN] as well as interpreting brown dwarfs spectra using Random Forest technique 
[e.g., @Lueber2023RandomForesr_BDs]. Here, we present one of the first applications of deep learning and convolutional neural networks on the interpretation brown dwarf 
atmospheric datasets. The configuration of a CNN and the key concepts can be found in [e.g., @Goodfellow_2016DeepLearning, @KIRANYAZ2021].

With the continuous observation of these objects and the increasing amount of data, there is a 
critical need for a systematic pipeline to quickly explore the datasets and extract important physical from them. In the future we can expand our pipeline to exoplanet atmospheres, and use it to provide insights about the diversity of exoplanets and brown dwarfs' 
atmospheric compositions. Ultimately,  `TelescopeML` will help facilitate the long-term analysis of this data in research. `TelescopeML`
is an ML Python package with Sphinx-ed user-friendly documentation that provides both trained ML models and ML tools 
for interpreting observational data captured by telescopes.






# Functionality and Key Features
`TelescopeML` is a Python package comprising a series of modules, each equipped with specialized machine learning and 
statistical capabilities for conducting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Machine Learning (ML) training on datasets 
captured from the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. The tasks executed by the `TelescopeML` modules are 
outlined below and visualized in following Figure:

- **DataMaster module**: Performs various tasks to process the datasets, including:
    - Preparing inputs and outputs
    - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
    - Scaling/normalizing the data
    - Visualizing the data
    - Conducting feature engineering
  
- **DeepTrainer module**: Utilizes different methods/packages such as TensorFlow to:
  - Build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model using the training examples
  - Utilize tuned hyperparameters
  - Fit/train the ML models
  - Visualize the loss and training history, as well as the trained model's performance
  
- **Predictor module**: Implements the following tasks to predict atmospheric parameters: 
  - Processes and predicts the observational datasets 
  - Deploys the trained ML/CNNs model to predict atmospheric parameters
  - Visualizes the processed observational dataset and the uncertainty in the predicted results
  
- **StatVisAnalyzer module**: Provides a set of functions to perform the following tasks: 
  - Explores and processes the synthetic datasets
  - Performs the chi-square test to evaluate the similarity between two datasets
  - Calculates confidence intervals and standard errors
  - Functions to visualize the datasets, including scatter plots, histograms, boxplots

# Documentation


`TelescopeML` is available and being maintained as a GitHub repository at
[github.com/EhsanGharibNezhad/TelescopeML](https://github.com/EhsanGharibNezhad/TelescopeML). Online 
documentation is hosted with _Sphinx_ using _ReadtheDocs_ tools and includes several instructions and tutorials 
as follows:

#  Users  and Future Developments

Astrophysicists with no prior machine learning knowledge can deploy the `TelescopeML` package and download the 
pre-trained ML or CNN models to interpret their observational data. In this scenario, pre-trained ML models, 
as well as the PyPI package, can be installed and deployed following the online instructions. Tutorials in the 
Sphinx documentation include examples for testing the code and also serve as a starting point. For this purpose, 
a basic knowledge of Python programming is required to install the code, run the tutorials, deploy the modules, 
and extract astronomical features from the datasets. The necessary machine learning background and a detailed 
guide for package installation, along with links to further Python details, are provided to help understand 
the steps and outputs.

Astrophysicists with machine learning expertise and data scientists can also benefit from this package by 
developing and fine-tuning the modules and pre-trained models to accommodate more complex datasets from 
various telescopes. This effort could also involve the utilization of new ML and deep learning algorithms, 
adding new capabilities such as feature engineering methods, and further optimization of hyperparameters 
using different and more efficient statistical techniques. The ultimate outcome from these two groups would 
be the creation of more advanced models with higher performance and robustness, as well as the extension of 
the package to apply to a wider range of telescope datasets.
